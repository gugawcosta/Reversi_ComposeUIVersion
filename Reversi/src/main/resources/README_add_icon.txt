Place your PNG file here so it can be loaded with painterResource("icon.png"):

Path: src/main/resources/icon.png

Notes:
- For Compose Desktop, resources placed in src/main/resources are available via painterResource("icon.png").
- If you prefer a different name/path, update painterResource(...) in GameApp.kt accordingly.
- Recommended size: 48x48 or a slightly larger PNG so it scales nicely with .size(48.dp).
